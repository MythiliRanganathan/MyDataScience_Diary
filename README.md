# Music Recommendation 
## The Context:
Music has been my constant companion and the source of my greatest joy for the most part of my life. As a music lover myself, I found it challenging to select songs that align with my personal preferences, particularly when I traveled the last time to India during the flight journey.

The internet and all the streaming applications have a huge collection of songs that make the choices overwhelming. We need a recommendation system that would engage the users and deliver content be it music, movies, or books according to the userâ€™s interest and preferences. It can also help users discover new music, and help them with social connections.

Recommendation systems do this by filtering and analyzing the past history of user choices, and then personlize the content to satisfy the user. These systems can design the model that is not biased towards certain artists, genres, languages or a discrete music style that promotes diversity and representation in the music industry.

## The objective:
To build recoemmndation model that suggests personalised songs that is more accurate.

## The problem formulation:
The use of efficient and accurate recommendation techniques is very important for a system that will provide good and useful recommendation to its individual users. This explains the importance of understanding the features and potentials of different data science recommendation algorithms.
