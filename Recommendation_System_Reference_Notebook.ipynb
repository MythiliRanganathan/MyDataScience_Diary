As a music lover myself, I found it challenging to select songs that align with my personal preferences, particularly when I traveled the last time to India during the flight journey. \n","\n","The internet and all the streaming applications have a huge collection of songs that make the choices overwhelming. We need a recommendation system that would engage the users and deliver content be it music, movies, or books according to the user’s interest and preferences. It can also help users discover new music, and help them with social connections. \n","\n","Recommendation systems do this by filtering and analyzing the past history of user choices, and then personlize the content to satisfy the user. These systems can design the model that is not biased towards certain artists, genres, languages or a discrete music style that promotes diversity and representation in the music industry.\n","\n","### **The objective:**\n","To build recoemmndation model that suggests personalised songs that is more accurate.\n","\n","### **The problem formulation**:\n","The use of efficient and accurate recommendation techniques is very important for a system that will provide good and useful recommendation to its individual users. This explains the importance of understanding the features and potentials of different data science recommendation algorithms."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BVUiyhYTHS1t"},"source":["## **Data Dictionary**\n","\n","The core data is the Taste Profile Subset released by the Echo Nest as part of the Million Song Dataset.

They are as follows:\n","\n","*   Popularity based recommendation systems\n","*   clustering-based recommendation systems\n","*   content-based recommendation systems\n","\n","To demonstrate clustering-based recommendation systems, surprise library has been used. Grid search cross-validation is applied to find the best working model, and with that the corresponding predictions are made.\n","\n","To evaluate the performance of these models, precision@k and recall@k are used in this case study. Using these two metrics F_1 score is calculated for each working model.\n","We can try to improve the performance of these models using hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","Recommendations for implementation - Proposed Solution Design :\n","Since we do not have explicit feedback from the user, such as \"user rating,likes\" we will need to account from more of the user's implicit feedback. We will use play count data points to measure the user's interest in the song the user is listening to.We propose a rating estimation method to infer user ratings from the user's implicit feedback.We will then use the estimated rating in various recommendation models and pick thebest-performing model. We expect the model to perform nicely and generate a personalised top 10 songs for each user.\n","\n","Further analysis /Next step\n","Although the precision score has shown great promise, the result is not perfect. There is a limitation with the current dataset in which we can improve the recommendation model's performance. Next step, we are keen to collect more implicit feedback data and explicit feedback. An example of implicit data could be the duration the user listens to the songs. An example of explicit feedback data is simply the user's explicit rating to express the user's affinity to the songs. Withthese additional datasets, the model would improve better.\n","\n","Music has always been known to change people's moods. Capturing and recognizing a person's emotion and displaying appropriate songs matching the person's mood can gradually calm their mind and end up giving a pleasing effect. People express their emotions primarily through their facial expressions. Our proposed system should aim to capture a person's emotion through facial expressions. The user's current emotion is used to generate an automatic music playlist on top of recoemmendation engine based on playcount & user rating."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
